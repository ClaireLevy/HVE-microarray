Calculating p values for functional categories

N = number of genes on array

F = a functional category, all genes in N are either F or notF

K = regulated genes

M = number of genes in N that are F. N-M = number of genes notF

x = genes from K that are determined to be F

The p value is:

The probability of seeing X or >X if K genes were picked RANDOMLY from N.

If this is very low, our results are more likely to be significant,i.e., that the regulated genes have an overrepresentation of genes that are in a certain functional group, when compared to a random selection of genes.

This is calculated using the chi-squared or hypergeometric distribution or using Fisher's exact test.

Using RDAVIDWebService

I could only get it to load if I opened Rstudio with R 32-bit version 3.1.1

Before, I got an error about not available for 3.1.2, then got 

Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
       call: fun(libname, pkgname)
       error: No CurrentVersion entry in Software/JavaSoft registry! 
       Try re-installing Java and make sure R and Java have matching architectures.
     Error: package ‘rJava’ could not be loaded

This website:http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gMCP/INSTALL 
suggested the following solution, which appeared to work 19Feb15


   Java is not installed or at least not in the correct variant.
   For example if you have only Java 32-bit on a 64-bit system
   and you start the 64-bit R you will run into this error.

DAVID


DAVID gene functional classification

Puts genes into different clusters, each of which has an enrichment score. Shows gene symbol and name/description of each gene in the group.


Functional Annotation
	
	functional annotation chart

 Identifies the most relevant (overrepresented) biological terms associated with a given gene list. Can sort by p-value, number of genes, etc. Category is the db where the term is associated with those genes (I guess?)

QUESTION: Do the categories just come from a db somewhere?


	Functional Annotation Clustering


The clustering algorithm puts the terms that the genes are associated with into clusters and lists the function related to that term. the minimum number of terms per cluster can be adjusted under "options".Default is 3.

	

	Functional Annotation Table
Same data organized by gene, with the terms associated with that gene under it.

Innate DB

Can input 10 samples at a time. Id is required and you can also enter expression values and p values. Looks like the output is more slick than DAVID

GSEA vs ORA?

From 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts389

Over-representation analysis (ORA) techniques, assessing the statistical overrepresentation of a user-defined, pre-selected gene/protein list of interest in a reference list of known gene/protein sets using a statistical test, e.g. the one-sided Fisher's exact test or the hypergeometric distribution.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) methods, which in contrast to classical annotation enrichment analyses incorporate expression level measurements from an unfiltered dataset, including non-parametric approaches such as GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), Catmap (Breslin et al., 2004), ErmineJ (Lee et al., 2005) and GeneTrail (Backes et al., 2007) and parametric approaches such as PAGE (Kim and Volsky, 2005), MEGO (Tu et al., 2005), FatiScan (Al-Shahrour et al., 2007) and GAGE (Luo et al., 2009).



From doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0079217

The earliest approach [2] used to identify a common thread through the observed gene expression changes by finding over-represented/enriched categories of molecules that shared a similar function is the Over-Representation Analysis (ORA). This method became popular once software tools were designed to mine existing gene annotation databases including Gene Ontology [4], biological pathways databases (e.g. KEGG [5], Reactome [6]) and other gene set collections (e.g. MSigDB [7]). Over-representation approaches rely on a basic contingency table analysis testing for the association between the Differential Expression (DE) status of a gene (DE or not) and its membership in a given gene category (e.g. the set of genes related to apoptosis). Typical distributions used to perform ORA include hypergeometric, chi-square (χ2), etc. and they are implemented in publically available tools such as Onto-Tools [8], [9], GOstat [10], GOstats [11], and DAVID [12], just to mention a few. The drawbacks of ORA approaches include the fact that they cannot be applied if no DE genes are found in a given study, for instance due to lack of statistical power, and that the analysis result depends on the threshold used to select the DE genes. Also, the common assumption behind the models used for ORA, such as independence between genes, is likely violated, potentially resulting in an inflated rate of false positive findings [13].



A second generation of methods, called Functional Class Scoring (FCS) methods, alleviates the need to select significant genes as a first step and provide a unique result for a given dataset. Typically, these approaches derive a score from all genes that belong to a given gene set regardless of whether or not they are differentially expressed. Such methods include Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [7], GLOBALTEST [14], SIGPATHWAY [15] with two alternative null hypotheses (Q1 and Q2), Gene Set Analysis (GSA) [16], Generally Applicable Gene set Enrichment (GAGE) [17], Significance Analysis of Functional categories in gene Expression studies (SAFE) [18], Mean-Rank Gene Set Enrichment tests (MRGSE) [19], Pathway Analysis with Down-weighting of Overlapping Genes (PADOG) [20] that we have proposed previously, and Correlation Adjusted Mean Rank gene set test (CAMERA) [21].
