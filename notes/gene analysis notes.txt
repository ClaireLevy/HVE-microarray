Calculating p values for functional categories

N = number of genes on array

F = a functional category, all genes in N are either F or notF

K = regulated genes

M = number of genes in N that are F. N-M = number of genes notF

x = genes from K that are determined to be F

The p value is:

The probability of seeing X or >X if K genes were picked RANDOMLY from N.

If this is very low, our results are more likely to be significant,i.e., that the regulated genes have an overrepresentation of genes that are in a certain functional group, when compared to a random selection of genes.

This is calculated using the chi-squared or hypergeometric distribution or using Fisher's exact test.

Using RDAVIDWebService

I could only get it to load if I opened Rstudio with R 32-bit version 3.1.1

Before, I got an error about not available for 3.1.2, then got 

Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
       call: fun(libname, pkgname)
       error: No CurrentVersion entry in Software/JavaSoft registry! 
       Try re-installing Java and make sure R and Java have matching architectures.
     Error: package ‘rJava’ could not be loaded

This website:http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gMCP/INSTALL 
suggested the following solution, which appeared to work 19Feb15


   Java is not installed or at least not in the correct variant.
   For example if you have only Java 32-bit on a 64-bit system
   and you start the 64-bit R you will run into this error.

DAVID


DAVID gene functional classification

Puts genes into different clusters, each of which has an enrichment score. Shows gene symbol and name/description of each gene in the group.


Functional Annotation
	
	functional annotation chart

 Identifies the most relevant (overrepresented) biological terms associated with a given gene list. Can sort by p-value, number of genes, etc. Category is the db where the term is associated with those genes (I guess?)

QUESTION: Do the categories just come from a db somewhere?


	Functional Annotation Clustering


The clustering algorithm puts the terms that the genes are associated with into clusters and lists the function related to that term. the minimum number of terms per cluster can be adjusted under "options".Default is 3.

	

	Functional Annotation Table
Same data organized by gene, with the terms associated with that gene under it.

Innate DB

Can input 10 samples at a time. Id is required and you can also enter expression values and p values. Looks like the output is more slick than DAVID

GO

The manual was too slim for me to get a good idea of how to use it. Newer features seem to be in development now?
