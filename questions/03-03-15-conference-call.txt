Gene set enrichment analysis questions
   1. Which database to prefer? 

   2. Which conditions to focus on?

Raw data questions
   1. The samples are described as HVE_X# where X is A, B, or C and # is 1-12. 
      What is the code?
   
   2. The raw data file includes the sample data, control data, and sample 
      table. How best to read it in? What is the sample table for? 

   3. If we read in just the sample data, lumi can figure it out. But then the
      control data is not included, and it's necessary for background 
      correction. The control data is formatted like this:
      
         TargetID    |  HVE_C5.AVG_Signal    | HVE_C5.BEAD_STDERR	   | ...

         In other words, there's a TargetID column and then three columns for 
         each sample (average signal, std error and number of beads). 

      The lumi package wants this:

         controlType |  probeID  | HVE_C5    | HVE_A1    | ...
      
         In other words, two leading columns and then just one column (average 
         signal) for each sample. 

      So long story short, we can't figure out how to read in the control data.

DEG questions:

1) What background should be used for DAVID?

Our project used the illumina humanHT v4 chip but using the v3 one offered as a background from DAVID is ok.


2) What about trying to access GO info via R?

Not worth it. 
CL says: I think it is still worth investigating in terms of setting up an efficient data pipeline.


3) So should we load subsrets of the data (timepoint.dose, up or down reg) separately into InnateDB or DAVID?

Yes, then save the results for comparison

4) Is it ok to let InnateDB do the ORA? 

Yes, and use the Fisher's exact test and we don't need to be so stringent at this point in the analysis. (Already used more stringent tests when determining DEGs)


5) Should we focus on GO, or pathways or interactions...?

Focus on gene ontology for now

6) What about cerebral?

Sure, use it.
