Gene set enrichment analysis questions
   1. Which database to prefer? 

   2. Which conditions to focus on?

Raw data questions
   1. The samples are described as HVE_X# where X is A, B, or C and # is 1-12. 
      What is the code?
   
   2. The raw data file includes the sample data, control data, and sample 
      table. How best to read it in? What is the sample table for? 

   3. If we read in just the sample data, lumi can figure it out. But then the
      control data is not included, and it's necessary for background 
      correction. The control data is formatted like this:
      
         TargetID    |  HVE_C5.AVG_Signal    | HVE_C5.BEAD_STDERR	   | ...

         In other words, there's a TargetID column and then three columns for 
         each sample (average signal, std error and number of beads). 

      The lumi package wants this:

         controlType |  probeID  | HVE_C5    | HVE_A1    | ...
      
         In other words, two leading columns and then just one column (average 
         signal) for each sample. 

      So long story short, we can't figure out how to read in the control data.
