Calculating p values for functional categories

N = number of genes on array

F = a functional category, all genes in N are either F or notF

K = regulated genes

M = number of genes in N that are F. N-M = number of genes notF

x = genes from K that are determined to be F

The p value is:

The probability of seeing X or >X if K genes were picked RANDOMLY from N.

If this is very low, our results are more likely to be significant,i.e., that the regulated genes have an overrepresentation of genes that are in a certain functional group, when compared to a random selection of genes.

This is calculated using the chi-squared or hypergeometric distribution or using Fisher's exact test.

Using RDAVIDWebService

I could only get it to load if I opened Rstudio with R 32-bit version 3.1.1

Before, I got an error about not available for 3.1.2, then got 

Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
       call: fun(libname, pkgname)
       error: No CurrentVersion entry in Software/JavaSoft registry! 
       Try re-installing Java and make sure R and Java have matching architectures.
     Error: package ‘rJava’ could not be loaded

This website:http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gMCP/INSTALL 
suggested the following solution, which appeared to work 19Feb15


   Java is not installed or at least not in the correct variant.
   For example if you have only Java 32-bit on a 64-bit system
   and you start the 64-bit R you will run into this error.
